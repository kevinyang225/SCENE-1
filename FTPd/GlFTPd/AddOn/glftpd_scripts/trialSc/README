## Trial script made by pnG

!! About
Monitors new users and msg siteop/deletes them as they dont succeed. Its a good 
idea to run this script crontabed to match the minimum setting. This script REQUIERS
perl to run. Perl is almost default on most unix systems, so that wont be
any problems

!! Installation

* Move trialSc.pl to your /glftpd/bin dir
* edit your settings in trialSc.pl
* setup a crontab for the script.

For example:
  If you have monthup as your setting, run this script once in the end of every month
  If you have weekup as your setting, run this script once every sunday

Some example crontab entrys:
Crontab entry for running the script every month:
0 0 30 * * /glftpd/bin/trialSc.pl > /dev/null

Crontab entry for running the script every week:
0 0 * * 0 /glftpd/bin/trialSc.pl > /dev/null

Crontab entry for running the script every day:
0 0 * * * /glftpd/bin/trialSc.pl > /dev/null
