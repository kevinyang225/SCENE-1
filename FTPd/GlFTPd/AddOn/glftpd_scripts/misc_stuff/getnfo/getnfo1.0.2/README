.1 Readme

Made by PnG 2002 GPL (png@strippa.net)

Well, I didnt see this one comming. I made this little
script for fun, and know it seems like everyone wants it.
What does it do then? Well, it reads the imdb number from
any movie nfo that gets uploaded to your site, and then finds
it on imdb.com and fetches all kind of information and prints
it to your glftpd.log file so your bot can output it in your
site channel!

It looks something like this:

<SiTEBOT> [SiTENAME]-(IMDB) - Snatched some info off IMDB on Lock, Stock... (2000). Directed by: Sheree Folkson (Genre: Drama User Rating: 7.2 / 10  URL: http://us.imdb.com/Title?0243714 ) Plot Outline: Unavailable... 
<SiTEBOT> Business: Lock, Stock... (2000) had a budget of $44m and was filmed in Pinewood Studios, London, England, UK

If you want aditional help with installing or whatever, 
join #getnfoscript on efnet and talk to either me (PnG), 
NiDO or ebzoner. But please, PLEASE read the readme and 
read through all the settings in getnfo.pl. If you are 
lame, dont even bother trying to install this.
 
BIG THANKS to:
