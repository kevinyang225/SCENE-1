| INTRODUCTION                                                                  |
|  To satisfy the long lasting audiophile's demand for a music scene of higher  |
|  quality than LAME mpeg compression encoding, and since nowdays space and     |
|  bandwidth are able to accomodate more, this set of rules were made to        |
|  initiate the LOSSLESS music scene space.                                     |
|  To avoid mistakes made in the music scene in the past, a group of old farts  |
|  gathered to decide upon these rules. A common understanding amongst all is   |
|  that material from non-physical media can easily be doubtful of its          |
|  origin of source and hence of questionable quality. To keep things simple    |
|  and to avoid mess as experienced in existing music scene, these rules        |
|  decided to strictly consider only physical media as a valid source.          |
|                                                                               |
| NOTE: The definitions of these keywords are to be interpreted as follows:     |
|       MUST=obligatory (not allowed if not comply).                            |
|       SHOULD=suggested.                                                       |
|       CAN+MAY=optional (allowed if not comply).                               |
|                                                                               |

| GENERAL                                                                       |

|  1.4 Releasing a previously released album again is only allowed if:          |
|      .1 The previous release was ripped from a lower quality source.          |
|         Higher to Lower: CD > Vinyl                                           |

|  1.5 Trackfixes are not allowed, bad quality rips require a complete repack.  |
|      Obligatory -REPACK- dir tagging (ref to rule 3.6).                       |
|  1.6 The following reasons can be a reason for a bad quality rip:             |
|      - One or more tracks from the release are incomplete or contain skips.   |
|      - The tracks are distorted and constantly clipping (eg. vinyl rips).     |
|      - The tracks contain a constant hiss which was avoidable (eg. vinyl rips)|
|      NOTE: A -PROPER- rip with no hiss should exist. (also -PROPER- must      |
|            mention which release its propering in nfo).                       |

|  7.2 Proof camera pictures must contain both, medium and cover together.      |
|      If cover isnt possible, a booklet or promo sheet or anything valid       |
|      proving ripper has release. If the medium/cover/booklet contain anything |
|      that may expose your identity, then that part of image can be blurred or |
|      blackened.                                                               |

|      Artist, title and any other relevant info that proves release, must not  |

|  7.4 GROUP tag must be photographed in the proof picture, software-edited     |
|      tags are considered invalid proof. Camera picture proof must not be      |
|      changed except to hide anything that might expose ripper (read rule 7.2).|
|  7.5 Additional scans may be added but DO NOT count for proof.                |
|  7.6 Proof camera pictures resolution must be at least 640 width and 480      |
|      height in JPEG format.                                                   |
|      Artist and/or album/single title must be clearly readable.               |
|  7.7 Proof fixes are not allowed, missing proof picture or bad resolution     |
|      requires a complete repack.                                              |
| NOTE: EXIF metadata should be removed from JPEG files! Uniquely identifying   |
|       information such as the camera serial number and GPS coordinates can    |
|       pose a security threat if not removed, so this is very ESSENTIAL!       |
