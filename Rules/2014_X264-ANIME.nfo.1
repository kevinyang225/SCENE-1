€    To keep up with todays standards a CRF of 16 to 19 is allowed to use.                        €
€    Most default settings today are fine, so we only have to adjust deblock/psyrd and motion     €
€    estimation method. 10Bit encodes won't be used since devices with HW-acceleration            €
€    are still rare and its only saving a little bit of space on CRF.                             €
€    10Bit will be standard on future HEVC devices.                                               €
€    The encoder must decide which CRF or bitrate he will use. The best shot is to go with CRF17  €
€    first and try not to hit 2.5GB/h limit.                                                      €
