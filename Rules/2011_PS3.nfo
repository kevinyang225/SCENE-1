1.0)  Release Rules:

  1.1)  Releases must be packed in RAR. SFV and NFO must be included.

  1.2)  Rar size should be split to allow a reasonable number of files. Releases
        should not contain over 101 rar files.

  0 to 4.700.372.992bytes folder = 50.000.000bytes rar files
  4.700.372.993bytes to 8.539.996.160bytes folder = 100.000.000bytes rar files
  8.539.996.161bytes to 18.253.611.008bytes folder = 200.000.000bytes rar files
  18.253.611.009bytes to 24.696.061.952bytes folder = 250.000.000bytes rar files
  24.696.061.953bytes to 32.212.254.720bytes folder = 300.000.000bytes rar files
  32.212.254.720bytes to 41.943.040.000bytes folder = 400.000.000bytes rar files
  more than 41.943.040.000bytes folder = 500.000.000bytes rar files

  1.3)  Rars must be compressed with M1 (fastest) or better.

  1.4)  Rars must not be compressed using M0 / No Compression

  1.5)  The image of the game must be in one of these formats:
        BLAS(ASIA), BLES(EUROPE), BLJM(Japan), BLJS(Japan), BLKS(Korea), BLUS(USA)

  1.6)  The game rip needs to be a full "dump". RIPPED / STRIPPED / 3D removed
        releases done as iNTERNAL will not shield said release from nuke.

  1.7)  If a game does not include the English language, this must be specified
        in the dir name unless the region tag implies that region's native
        language is the only language in the game eg. game tagged JPN is 
        Japanese only, hence does not need to state the language.

  1.8)  If a game is rereleased for having additional foreign languages, the 
        dir must be tagged MULTI and the nfo must specify which additional 
        languages are included.

  1.9)  Source of game disc origin must be included in nfo or be tagged 
        in the dirname. Non-region tagged releases without source information 
        included in nfo will be nuked until they are dirfixed or nfofixed.
        A PROPER for this nuke will not be acceptable.

  1.10) Suggested directory format:

  Game.Name.<PROPER/READ.NFO/REPACK>.USA.JB.PS3-GRPNAME
  Game.Name.MULTI.<PROPER/READ.NFO/REPACK>.JB.PS3-GRPNAME
  Game.Name.<PROPER/READ.NFO/REPACK>.EUR.PS3-GRPNAME
  Game.Name.MULTI.<PROPER/READ.NFO/REPACK>.PS3-GRPNAME

  1.11)  Only these caracteres are allowed in dirname:

  ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789.-_

2.0)  Additional Releases:

  2.1)  Patches for the lastest JB.ready firmware should be included in a CRACK
        dir (Modified Eboot/param.sfo) 

  2.2)  If an update is avaible and crackable, it should be included in an
        UPDATE dir. 

  2.3)  Suggested directory format for updates(if the update is pred alone):  

  Game.Name.<PROPER/READ.NFO/REPACK>.UPDATE.VERSiON.JB.PS3-GRPNAME
  Game.Name.<PROPER/READ.NFO/REPACK>.UPDATE.VERSiON.PS3-GRPNAME
   
  2.4)  Source of update origin must be included in nfo.       
        Can also be tagged in dirname.
 
  2.5)  Suggested directory format for eboot patch (in case that the eboot
        wasn't contained in a previous rlz or if a patch is now available for
        a game that could not be cracked at the time of the PRE.)

  Game.Name.<PROPER/READ.NFO/REPACK>.Eboot.Patch.JB.PS3-GRPNAME
  Game.Name.<PROPER/READ.NFO/REPACK>.Eboot.Patch.PS3-GRPNAME

  2.6}  PSN related releases will be regarded as PS3 releases and will
        adhere to this ruleset. PSN related releases must have the tag PSN
        in the directory name. Recommended directory format is:

  Game_Name_<REGION>_<MULTI#/PROPER/READNFO/REPACK/CRACK/etc.>_PSN_PS3-GRPNAME
  Game.Name.<REGION>.<MULTI#/PROPER/READNFO/REPACK/CRACK/etc.>.PSN.PS3-GRPNAME

3.0)  Proof must be included:
 
  3.1)  All releases from physical sources must always include proof. PSN
        releases will be exempt from proof requirements as they are downloadable.

  3.2)  Proof means a good quality scan or photo of the BluRay together with
        the cover or a booklet page so the proof can be identified as the
        release in question. If the medium or cover/booklet contain anything that
        may expose your identity, then that part of the image can be blurred or
        blackened. Additional scans may be added but these DO NOT count as
        sufficient proof!
 
  3.3)  A note with the group name on the proof is required.

  3.4)  Proof resolution must be at least 640x480 or 480x640 pixels or higher in
        standard JPEG format.

  3.5)  Prooffixes
        If you fail to add scans/photos you have 24 hours AFTER NUKE to release a
        Prooffix. During and after this 24 hours grace period, any other group is
        allowed to release a PROPER with scans/photos.

  NOTE We STRONGLY recommend the removal of all Exif data! Uniquely identifying
  information such as the camera serial number and GPS coordinates can pose
  a security threat if not removed. Use tools such as jhead, PureJPG,
  EXIFCleaner or the inbuilt function of Win7/Vista to remove the Exif data.
