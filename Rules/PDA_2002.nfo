  Machine-Type : e.g. N9210 or N9210i  (Nokia Communikator)


 <program name>.vX.xx.<optional Language>.CPU.OP-SYS.<cracktype>-<groupname>          

 OP-SYS can be                                                                        
  
  CE      that is CE 2.0                                                              
  PPC     that is for WinCE 3.0 but its not called CE, 99runs also on new ARM       
          machines with PPC2002                                                       
  HPC2000 that is a HandheldPC with keyboard (no pen) only ONE from HP existing                       
  PPC2002 that is successor of PPC now most common and runs only on ARM machines                      

 CPU types can be

  SH3 is SH3 CPU                                                                      
  MIPS is MIPS CPU                                                                    
  ARM is STRONG ARM CPU                                                               
  IPAQ is NOT a cpu but runs ARM , there are progs that run only on IPAQ so IPAQ has  
  to be named as CPU                                                                  

  For future extensions :
  If there is a program version for a special machine then name the machine type      
  instead of the cpu ( see the IPAQ example above ! )                                 


 or use underscores if you like:

 <program name>_vX.xx_<optional Language>_PalmOS_<cracktype>-<groupname>
 <program name>_vX.xx_<optional Language>_ALL_OP-SYS_<cracktype>-<groupname>          
 <program name>_vX.xx_<optional Language>_SymbianOS_<cracktype>-<groupname>          
             

 <groupname> has to be <name>pda  to part the pda section !!

 CRACKTYPES :
 ************
 
  can be :
 
  Regged                serial data is included in nfo 
  Cracked               the program file has been altered to register the
                        proggy. The program is then "Preregistered", "any
                        name and/or serial can be entered" or "nags/trials
                        removed"                     
  Incl.Keymaker         if keymaker is included in package
  Incl.Keymaker.Patch   if program is patched and shows correct
                        serial relating to the hotsyncname(palmos,ppc) after
                        program start or after entering any serial
  Incl.PalmOS.Keymaker  if keymaker for PalmOS is in the package (if you wanna
                        use some kind of plugin system for your keygen you HAVE
                        to incl. the plugin-proggy too (not only the plugin))
  Incl.WinCE.Keymaker   if keymaker for WinCE is in the package (if you wanna
                        use some kind of plugin system for your keygen you HAVE
                        to incl. the plugin-proggy too (not only the plugin))
  Incl.Java.Keymaker    if keymaker comes via java applet, the java applet has
                        to be delivered with a name.html file that loads the
                        java app.

  if a Keymaker is only in the package then a url to get the prg has to be
  included in nfo !

  if a Serial (HOTSYNC independent!) is only in the package then a url to get the prg
  has to be included in nfo !

 RELEASE RULES :
 ***************
  
 Release format/size :
  
 If a release is bigger than 1.44 mb then it has to be parted in 1.44/2.88 MB
 packages ( ISO can be packed with rar (most common) )
  
  
                                   
  Keygens:     A keymaker is allowed to be only (re-)released                            
               1) when a major version hop of the application occurs i.e.
                  1.xx -> 2.xx 
               2) when the key algo changes. An algo-change has to be announced        
                   by including READ.NFO in dirname AND a short           
                   description in the nfo (for example: "Keygenalgo changed ...")                     
               3) when there has not been a re-release within a 1 year.
                                  
               Example(1) : Keymaker released first time for v1.43 .
                The first time it can be replaced for not being a dupe is when
                the version changes to v2.xx or if the keyalgo changes. So also
                in v1.44 ;)
               Example(2): Prog.v1.1.incl.Keymaker-GRP released 01/01/2000
                the next allowed release date for Prog.v1.11.incl.Keymaker-GRP
                would be 01/01/2001. Its (of course) not allowed to release the                        
                SAME version again after a 1 year :P
                                   
               Keymaker.Only releases are allowed, but then include the url where
               where to download the program in the nfo.
                                                                                                          
  Keygenpatch: A Keygenpatch is a patch that alters the program that it shows the
               right serial for the actual hotsync (and which regs it of course).
               Keygenpatches are like Keygens (same rules here) with one difference:
               Its allowed to release a Keygen after a Keygenpatch 
               (even for the same version)

  Cracks:      Cracks in form of patched programs can be released for every
               version UNTIL they got keygened or a serial is released.
               If a keygen or serial gets invalid for some reason a new crack           
               can be released.
                                  
  Regged:      Can be a serial or name + serial. (hotsync id independent) 
  (Serial)     Same rules as for keygens apply here (major version hops, serial
               change, 1 year rule...)                                                                        
                                                                                            
  Retail:      A retail is treated like a crack with these exceptions:
               - You are allowed to release a retail after 
                 a serial/crack/keygen/keygenpatch IF (!) there's something special
                 added (some kind of extra stuff that you dont have in the shareware/
                 demo version). If thats the case you have to add a READ.NFO to the
                 dirname and list whats the additional stuff.
       
             Normally retails should be released when its not possible to download
             an uncrippled version which can be regged/keygenned.
                        
             
  All releases must be (zip-)packed with the necessary files for the release and
  a .nfo and .diz from the group.                                                         
       
   IMPORTANT INFO TO SITEOPs : 
   *************************** 
    
  As we have seen in the past, there are some rules which prevent groups
  releases being nuked on an affiliate site.  We think that if a valid nuke
  reason applies to any release, it should be nuked on all sites - affil or
  not.

                 ->>> AFFIL PREVENTS NOT FROM BEEING NUKED !! <<
