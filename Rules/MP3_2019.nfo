                        Official MP3 Release Rules 4.0
        _______________________________________________________________

 1. No Dupes !
    Complete albums/releases are checked, not single tracks. So a
    release is not a dupe if it has different or more tracks.
    Exceptions:
    1.1. It's also a dupe if the complete release is included in a
         previous one. For example CDM is released, now someone releases
         the CDS and all tracks of the CDS were already included on the
         CDM (exactly the same tracks).

    1.2. You are allowed to create a duplicate release of a release that
         has a source of lower quality (a different source!).
         Example: if Vinyl is out then a CD-release is allowed.
         For online bought MP3s (-WEB-) we assume the best source quality
         (CDDA or better).

    1.3. All MIXED CDs should be ripped as one track supplied with a
         .cue. However if they're not, another group can release it this
         way afterwards, with neither release getting nuked because of
         the other.

    1.4. It is allowed to release a physical medium version after a WEB
         or FLASH version. Note that this includes physical medium
         releases even when they are also available to download for free
         online.
         Proofing rule (see section 19) always applies to physical medium.

    1.5. If an unmixed version of a release is available in webshops, it
         is allowed for both mixed physical and unmixed WEB versions to
         be released. 


    For all LIVE sources:
      + If a show has already been released (e.g. another name, but the
        mix is the same), no dupe of that same show is allowed. If the
        show is included in another release (for example, as a guest
        mix), then it is not allowed either.
      + If a show, containing a guest mix, is a partial dupe (either the
        regular part of the show, or the guest mix), it is allowed to
        release them both as a set. However, it is encouraged to release
        only the new part if the other part is available in equal or
        better quality, denoting in the nfo why the other part was omitted.
      + If a show contains the broadcast of a commercially released CD,
        it may not be released if the CD has already been released. 

    Note: if you want to release an import-album or some "extended
    edition" then check rule 7 as well !

 2. An SFV and NFO file must be included in every release.
    All releases from a physical medium must also include a JPG proof -
    see rule 19. CUE, M3U and additional JPG files (scans) are optional.
    If you release a CUE file for multitrack mp3s then the CUE file must
    include artist and tracknames if they are available on the cover or
    inlay. If you want to release additional material (Videos, Lyrics,
    ...) from the source medium then you must release that separately
    with dirname tag -EXTRAS-.

 3. Directoryname must at least contain:
    3.1. Artist Name - Title - Published Year (decimal) - Group name
         (extra info is allowed of course)

    3.2. All bootleg releases must have the word BOOTLEG in dirname.
         (check bootleg rule 14)

    3.3. If you release magazine CDs then you must tag them as -MAG-.
         Don't tag them -PROMO-, -ADVANCE-, etc.

    3.4. The directory name of an INTERNAL release must end with _INT.
         Example: Someone_Something-2007-GROUP_INT

    3.5. For all LIVE sources:
         It is not necessary to include the name of the station the show
         is broadcasted on (if it is not included in the directory name,
         it is strongly encouraged to include it in the nfo instead). The
         date must be the date of the broadcast. Both USA (-MM/DD-) and
         EU (-DD/MM-) date format is allowed.

    3.6. Multi-disc releases must have a multi-disc source tag. (-2CD-,
         -3DVD-, ...)

    3.7. If you use "various artists" as artistname then you must use
         "VA" in releasedir.
         Example: VA-Some_Cool_Party_Mix-2CD-2019-GROUP

    3.8. To tag it as original soundtrack (OST) use an additional -OST-
         tag (after title).
         "OST" as artist in releasedir is not allowed.
         Example: VA-Some_Cool_Movie-OST-WEB-2019-GROUP

    3.9. Releases from source -WEB- need an additional -SINGLE- tag
         (after title) if they have only one track.
         Exception: Single-file WEB releases that contain more than one
         tracks or parts, or are longer than 25 minutes do not require
         the -SINGLE- tag.

    Exception:
    If a Vinyl/CD has no title then it's allowed to replace the title by
    labelname+catnumber (both!). If there is only one artist on the
    Vinyl/CD then you must add the artistname.

 4. Filename must at least contain: 
    Track Number - Song Title
    If it's an album with different artists (one artist per track) then
    you must add the artist name as well ("VA-tracks" like mixes don't
    need artistnames).
    The song title for the filename must include the full title as it's
    written on the cover/CD/inlay with all additional infos like
    remixed/featured stuff as long as it doesn't exceed the 128 char limit.

    Filenames should be unique to the best of your knowledge. Especially
    if you're doing a Repack, Rerip or Proper.

    Exception:
    If no tracknames are supplied by the source (CD, Vinyl, ...) then
    you *must* provide proof that these tracks have no names. Either by
    a scan of the original cover of the record company/label (no
    selfmade cdr or bootleg covers) or a link to an official or trusted
    webpage with proofs. If these "untitled tracks" are part of a big
    mix (no silence between the "tracks") then it's considered as one
    track and you must rip it as one mp3/cue and give this track same
    name as the "album".

 5. Files/directories must only contain characters a-z A-Z 0-9 _ . - () 
    This is to avoid problems with windows/linux-filesystem and ftp-servers.

 6. Self-made releases
    6.1. Self-made compilations are not allowed !
         A self-made compilation is when you select tracks from other
         sources, put them together and release that as something new.

    6.2. A self-made MIX or completely self-made music is not allowed
         either. If you are releasing self-made stuff then that must be
         tagged as internal.

 7. Bonus Tracks / Bonus Discs / Boxsets 
    7.1. The entire Medium (CD, Vinyl, ...). must be released (not
         individual tracks). This means that even if there is only one
         additional (bonus) or otherwise previously unreleased different
         track, you must still release the whole medium.
         Note that just different track length does not automatically
         mean it's a different track, if the only difference in audio is
         varying length of silence at the beginning or end of a track.
    7.2. It is NOT allowed to re-release a new edition of a retail album
         if the different/extra/bonus tracks are already included in one
         previous release. For example, USA album is released and four
         months later Japanese version is released containing simply a
         remix from an old CDM/CDS release as a bonus track, it would not
         be considered new material and then would not be allowed to
         release as a complete release. Note this does not apply to
         tracks from an old compilation of Various Artists.

    7.3. If a boxset contains several sources (e.g. Vinyl+CD) then those
         disc(s) must be released seperately (so there's only one source
         per release).

    7.4. Boxsets with different artists must be released together if they
         are same source format (e.g. all CDDA).

    7.5. It is allowed to release only part of a boxset (discs, not
         individual tracks) if that part is available separately on
         another medium (e.g. WEB). If you do that you MUST add a proof
         URL (to that other medium release, WEB in previous example) to
         your NFO file.

    7.6. For DVD(A) releases check Rule 10.

 8. Current maximum directory/filename-length is 128 characters 
    Exception: Dirfixes that reach the limit by adding "-DIRFIX-"

 9. No fake-releases
    It's a fake release when artist, title, group or source is incorrect
    (different).
    examples:
    - Some_Artist-Crappy_Music-2004-GRP not released by GRP
    - Another_Artist-Lots_of_Noise-CDM-2004-GRP was ripped from TV or
    downloaded from a paysite
    - Madonna-Something_New-2004-GRP really containing some tracks by
    Marilyn Manson

10. DVD/DVDA Ripping
    A DVD/DVDA release must contain all music tracks. Additional tracks
    (interviews etc.) are optional. If those extra tracks are not
    included then a proper (with ALL tracks) or an additional release
    (extra tracks only) is not allowed.

    If tracks are available in several audio formats then you must use
    the "best" version.
    Priority is:
    - PCM stereo (doesn't matter if DVDA or CDDA quality)
    - PCM 3+ channels
    - AC3 (dolby digital) stereo or DTS stereo
    - AC3 (dolby digital) 3+ channels or DTS 3+ channels
    - MPG

    Examples:
    - DVD contains AC3 5.1 and AC3 2.0 => you must rip the AC3 2.0 tracks
    - DVD contains PCM and AC3 2.0 => you must rip the PCM tracks
    - DVD contains MPG and AC3 2.0 => you must rip the AC3 2.0 version

    Normalizing the sound volume is allowed but optional.

11. Encoding Quality
    11.1. For releases where the source is MP3 file(s) (WEB,FLASH,MP3CD):
          VBR (all combinations, but no maximum bitrate limit) and CBR
          with following bitrates is allowed:
          -WEB- 320 kbit only
          -MP3CD- music: 192-320 kbit (you must choose the highest bitrate
                  available)
          -MP3CD- audiobook: ALL bitrates
          -FLASH- 192-320 kbit (you must choose the highest bitrate
                  available)
          Release the MP3 unmodifed as you downloaded/copied it. It is NOT
          allowed to re-encode!
          Adding/changing ID3 or other tags is allowed.
          If the FLASH medium contains both WAV and MP3 then you must
          choose WAV.

    11.2. For ALL sources that need encoding (CD, VINYL, DVD, BLU-RAY,
          WEB-WAV, SBD, CABLE, SAT, LINE, etc.):

          You must use LAME 3.100 with preset V0 ("-V0") without any
          additional switches that would affect the mp3 quality.

          Note: from 2019-03-15 00:00:00 to 2019-04-14 23:59:59 it is
          allowed to use either LAME 3.98.4 or LAME 3.100.

    11.3. The sampling rate must be either 44.1khz or 48khz. 32khz is not
          allowed. Downsampling to 44.1 or 48khz is allowed (if source is
          better), upsampling to 44.1 or 48khz is not allowed.

    11.4. For all LIVE sources: Straight-to-mp3 encoding is allowed, but
          discouraged. The header of the mp3 file must be correct at all
          times.

    11.5. On rare occasion, there may be defects in the actual
          pressing/mastering/recording/etc. in a given audio source (ie.
          skips, glitches, etc).
          If these audio defects are identified beforehand in initial nfo
          or in a later nfofix, then a release cannot be considered
          invalid until there is a valid one pred. (ie; proper release
          clean of audio defects) 

12. Promos
    If a release is considered not to be complete version or include all
    tracks, then it must be labeled as a promo and can be duped by any
    legitimate retail release that DOES contain all tracks. The
    legitimate release can be identified by the CAT number, or more
    suitable proof.

    Promos do not have to contain track listings, they are promotional
    material, they are not considered legitimate releases, and are still
    governed by quality rules.

    If you release a promo when the retail is already out then you must
    provide proof that this promo is real to make sure this is not a
    selfmade "promo".

13. Re-encodes are not allowed.
    Exception: releases of following sources are currently allowed if
    they are tagged correctly:
    DVD, DAB, DVBC/DVBS/DVBT/SAT/CABLE (compressed digital
    tv/radio sat,cable,terrestrial), MD (live)

14. All bootleg releases must have the word BOOTLEG in dirname
    A bootleg recording is a CD/Vinyl/DVD that was not officially
    released by the person/company owning the rights to do that (for
    example streetmixes, pirate live CDs, etc).

    Because very often it's not 100% clear if something is bootleg there
    are conditions when we assume something is or isn't bootleg. This is
    not a definition of "bootleg" and if a condition is not true then it
    does not mean the opposite is true. This only helps nukers and
    groups to decide if a bootleg tag is needed and hopefully leads to
    more fair nuking.

    conditions for:
    [records done completely by the artist] (no samples from other artists)
    It's bootleg if ...
    - there are no signs that the label really released this

    - the "label" has no connection to the artist
    (independent releases (no label, own label) are allowed and don't
    need a bootleg tag)

    even if the conditions above are true it is NOT bootleg if:
    - the record is available at at least 3 major retail shops

    conditions for:
    [mixes] (samples of other artists included)
    It's not bootleg if ...
    - the record is available at at least 3 major retail shops
    - the label exists and lists the record and the label never released
    any bootlegs and released stuff that was available at major retail shops
    - the artist or label of the samples confirms this release is valid
    (on their webpage or some other trusted place)

    "major retail shops" currently are:
    www.amazon.com (.de, .fr ...)
    www.bestbuy.com
    www.walmart.com
    www.cduniverse.com
    www.sonymusicstore.com
    www.juno.co.uk
    www.deejay.de
    www.ukdancerecords.com
    www.decks.de
    www.4djsonly.com

    The shop itself must sell the record (no private sellers).

15. SOURCE
    All tracks of a release must be from same source and have same
    quality/cbr-bitrate/vbr-setting/encoder/setting (Exception: FLASH
    releases). Taking tracks from other scene releases or internal group
    releases of other groups is strictly forbidden.
    If the source is not a pressed CDDA then the directory name needs a
    valid source tag. Valid tags are listed below.

          - bitrate of source (448kbps, 640kbps, 768kbps, 1536kbps...)
          - number of channels of source (stereo, 5.1, ...)
       
         [BLU-RAY DISC RECORDABLE]
         dirtag needed: -BDR- (-2BDR- -3BDR- etc.)
         extra nfo info needed:
          - codec of source (AC3, DD+, PCM, MPG, DTS, DTS-HD, Dolby TrueHD)
          - bitrate of source (448kbps, 640kbps, 768kbps, 1536kbps...)
          - number of channels of source (stereo, 5.1, ...)
       
         [DAT TAPE] 
         dirtag needed: -DAT- (-2DAT- -3DAT- etc.)
       
         [MP3CD] (mp3 files on a data-CD, legally available and not free)
         dirtag needed: -MP3CD- (-2MP3CD- -3MP3CD- etc.)
         extra nfo info needed:
          - proof photo of medium+cover 
          - proof URL to artist, label or shop where it's available 
       
         [UNKNOWN]
         dirtag needed: -BOOTLEG-

    All other "sources" are invalid source tags (-LIVE- , -EP-, ...).
    Which means you need a second tag for the source if you use those
    tags (except for CDs which don't need a source tag).

    A SBD release is not allowed if it could be a re-encode/repack of
    the same show streamed or downloaded free from inet. If a free
    broadcast or download is/was available with 160kbit CBR or better
    then it's not allowed to do a SBD release.

16. Fixes
    16.1. Trackfixes / ID3TAG-fixes
          Trackfixes and ID3TAG-fixes are not allowed.
          If you want to fix a release because one or more tracks are
          damaged or tagged incorrectly then you must release a REPACK to
          fix it.
    16.2. Dirname
          If you release a dirfix then the dirname of the problematic
          release must be listed in your NFO file.
          If a release gets nuked for BAD DIRNAME then the releasegroup
          has 72 hours to release a dirfix. If they don't do it within the
          72 hours then any other group is allowed to release it.
          The 72 hours start when the release gets nuked.
    16.3. Prooffixes
          If you fail to add scans/photos you have 24 hours AFTER PRE to
          release a Prooffix.
          If a provided proof was judged inadequate and nuked, you have 24
          hours AFTER NUKE to release a prooffix.
          Before, during and after this 24 hours grace period, any other
          group is allowed to release a PROPER with scans/photos even if
          the mp3 content is 100% identical.

17. ID3 Tags
    All mp3 files need an ID3 v1.1 and ID3 v2 tag. This tag must include
    Artist, Title and Album (see Note #3). The fields Year, Genre and
    Tracknumber must be present, but a release can not be nuked simply
    because they're incorrect.

18. LIVE release quality
    18.1. The set must be complete. This means that every part of the show
          must be released, and the beginning and end must be included in
          their entirety. A set may not miss more than 1 minute from begin
          or end.
    18.2. All commercials must be edited out.
    18.3. DJ talk can be included to a certain extent: track announcements
          and short lines from the DJ should not be removed; interviews
          and other long talk should be removed (or included in a separate
          file if it's special).
    18.4. It is encouraged to fade-in and fade-out the set. However, lack
          of fades constitutes no proper reason. 

19. Scans/Photos
    19.1. All releases from physical sources must always include proof.
    19.2. Proof means a good quality scan or photo of the physical medium
          together with the cover or a booklet page so the proof can be
          identified as the release in question. If the medium or
          cover/booklet contain anything that may expose your identity,
          then that part of the image can be blurred or blackened.
          Additional scans may be added but these DO NOT count as
          sufficient proof!
          For bundled versions of two or more sources, it is allowed to
          use cover and medium of these sources as long as it was
          distributed as a bundle and not separately. (examples: 1 - DVD
          cover format with CD. 2 - Vinyl cover format with CD). For
          multi-disc sets, all medium of same source must be together with
          the cover or a booklet page so the proof can be identified as
          the release in question. Make your proof as close as possible to
          the included examples.
    19.3. A note with the group name on the proof is optional except for
          releases without cover - rule 19.6.
    19.4. Proof resolution must be 640x480/480x640 pixels or higher in
          standard JPEG format. Maximum filesize for the JPG file is 5mb
          (5242880 bytes).
    19.5. We STRONGLY recommend removal of all Exif data! Uniquely
          identifying information such as camera serial number and GPS
          coordinates can pose a security threat if not removed. Use tools
          such as jhead, PureJPG or EXIFPurge to remove the Exif data.
    19.6. Whitelabel, test presses and promo releases officialy
          distributed without cover/case/artwork cover requires note with
          group name over the medium. 

20. FLASH medium ripping
    20.1. A FLASH release must contain all music tracks. For additional
          stuff (videos, pictures etc.) see rule 2.
    20.2. If the FLASH medium contains WAV files you must encode them with
          scene standards.
    20.3. If the FLASH medium contains multiple formats (e.g. 10 tracks
          WAV and a DJ MIX MP3) it is allowed to release it with mixed
          VBR/CBR and multiple encoders. 

21. High Definition Ripping
    21.1. A HD DVD/BLU-RAY release must contain complete music track from
          concert. Additional tracks (interviews, videos, bonus etc.) are
          optional.
          If those extra tracks are not included then a proper (with ALL
          tracks) or an additional release (extra tracks only) is not
          allowed.
    21.2. HD DVD and BLU-RAY video clip releases should be ripped as multi
          track release keeping original tracklist (not .m2ts sequence).
    21.3. If tracks are available in several audio formats then you must
          use the highest bitrate lossless source track. DTS core must be
          extracted from a DTS HR/HD MA track (if that is the source in use).
    21.4. Multi channel audio must be downmixed to stereo 2 channels.
    21.5. Downsampling to 44.1 or 48khz is allowed (if source is better),
          upsampling to 44.1 or 48khz is not allowed.
    21.6. Normalizing the sound volume is allowed but optional.
    21.7. CUE file made from source chapters should always be included
          with final release package.
    21.8. HD DVD/BLU-RAY release is NOT allowed if retail CD version with
          same tracks has been released already. 

22. Security
    22.1. URL shorteners (like tinyurl or goo.gl) are not allowed ANYWHERE
          in the release.
          Do NOT use them in NFO, ID3-tag or anywhere else! 

Notes:

 1. The Year in dirname is not the year when you released it but when
    the record company/artist published it. It MUST be correct. If it's
    not possible to find the correct year use "x"s (e.g. "-199x-").
 2. If a release labeled as "advance" is identical to a retail version,
    then it is not allowed to be duped and it counts as a retail for ALL
    rules. If a retail version is different then it's allowed to be
    released of course.
 3. Artist and Title in directoryname MUST both be correct. However
    incorrectly converted foreign characters are tolerated. Typos in
    trackname and/or ID3-tag are tolerated if it is still readable and
    either artist or title is 100% correct.
 4. The audio of a normal video DVD is NOT DVDA ! The audio of a DVD
    usually is MP2/AC3/DTS compressed (lossy) while the audio of a real
    DVDA is high quality PCM (lossless, e.g. 24bit/192khz). Tagging a
    normal DVD release as -DVDA- will get nuked.
