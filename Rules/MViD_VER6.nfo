######  CONTAINERS  ###########################################################


    1.1)  Allowed containers are: MKV
    1.2)  MKV container:

        1.2.1) mkvmerge MUST BE USED to mux.
        1.2.2) Soft subbed lyrics are optional.
        1.2.3) Hard subbed lyrics are not allowed.
        1.2.4) Setting chapters in mkvmerge is allowed, but not required.
        1.2.5) Header compression must be disabled in mkvmerge by adding the following to
               the BEGINNING of the command line: --compression -1:none


######  AUDIO  #################################################################


    2.1)  Allowed audio formats are: MP2, MP3, AAC, AC3, and lossy DTS.  DTS is allowed from retail sources only.
    2.2)  All audio must have a minimum sample rate of 44.1kHz.
    2.3)  The first/default audio track MUST BE FULLY SYNCED.
    2.4)  When no lip-sync is present in the video, you must use audio which matches the source.
          If you're unsure about this, put an alternative version as a 2nd track.
    2.5)  Replacement audio, if exists:

        2.5.1) The best quality replacement audio for the song must be used.  If multiple retail audio
               sources exist, any may be used but whichever has the highest average bitrate is recommended.
        2.5.2) The best quality replacement audio for any sfx must be used.
        2.5.3) In the event mixing song and sfx sources causes an obvious difference in quality, or the
               speed (or pitch) difference is too great, the original source audio must be used.
        2.5.4) Audio used for bootlegs, mixtapes, promos, etc. is often NOT the final mastered
               retail audio.  Releases using these sources can be propered if/when final retail
               audio becomes available UNLESS it is near-same quality.

    2.6)  When using scene or self-encoded audio:

        2.6.1) 2 channel audio must be MP3.  3 or more channel audio must be AC3.
        2.6.2) MP3 scene audio must not be nuked for a technical reason relating to the source (or encoded)
               audio being used at the time the music video is pre'd.
        2.6.3) Ripper-encoded MP3s must be in compliance with the most current MP3 scene ruleset settings.
        2.6.4) AC3 must be encoded at 128kbit per channel, with a maximum of 640kbit.
        2.6.5) Advanced AC3 encoder settings such as gain changes, filters, etc. are not allowed.

    2.7)  Audio from a vinyl source is not allowed under any circumstances.
    2.8)  If part of the source audio is only available from the source itself, it must be inserted
          into the replacement audio.  This includes all sound effects.
    2.9)  Transcoding unedited/untouched audio from one codec to another (unless to comply with 2.1), or
          re-encoding at a higher bitrate will NOT increase quality in ANY way, therefore not allowed.
    2.10) If no editing is required, the replacement audio must be directly inserted as-is.
    2.11) Multiple audio streams are allowed at the rippers discretion.  For example,
          including both censored and uncensored audio, or multichannel AC3 audio.
    2.12) Altering the audio in any unnecessary way is not allowed.  If gain adjustment is needed to even the
          volume between sfx and music, the sfx gain should be adjusted and music gain left alone. Do NOT normalize
          audio under any circumstances!
    2.13) Variable Bitrate WEB audio sources must have a minimum average bitrate of 160kbit.  Constant Bitrate
          WEB audio sources must have a minimum bitrate of 192kbit.


######  VIDEO  #################################################################


    3.1)  Allowed codecs: x264
    3.2)  Video source MUST BE digital and NOT be passed thru any analog
          equipment (svideo output, analog capture card, etc.).
    3.3)  Releasing raw source is NOT allowed!
    3.4)  FPS must match that of the source, unless any of the following exceptions are met AND the
          replacement audio is in sync with the altered FPS:

        3.4.1) IVTC is applied.
        3.4.2) 50+ FPS sources where every other frame is a dupe, in which case half-framerate is allowed.
        3.4.3) Videos that don't need or contain any deinterlacing may be reversed/decimated back to their
               original FPS and considered native if the source was sped up/down, or contains dupe frames
               in the following orders: 5,6,25
        3.4.4) Converts where a restore/deinterlace method can be used to reverse back to the original FPS.

    3.5)  Dupe frames must be removed unless needed to maintain sync.
    3.6)  Encodes must be within 5% of the original aspect ratio.  To calculate
          the AR % error use: (Release - Original AR)/Original AR x 100
    3.7)  Upscaling is not allowed.
    3.8)  Telecined video must be MANUALLY IVTC'ed using:

              2:2 pulldown NTSC/PAL
              3:2 pulldown NTSC

        3.8.1) If IVTC is not possible, the reason must be stated in your nfo.

    3.9)  For non-telecined interlaced video, a deinterlacer must be applied before
          encoding.

          * It's STRONGLY RECOMMENDED you DO NOT use the following deinterlacers/filters
            due to poor quality output:  fielddeinterlace, dgbob, decomb/telecide, VerticalReduceBy2

    3.10) Interlace of ANY KIND is not allowed.  If you can see it, it's not allowed.  No exceptions.
    3.11) Vfapi creates unnecessary colorspace conversions resulting in degraded color quality
          and is not recommended.

          To avoid this if using TMPGEnc for manual IVTC, use "tprivtc" to import your
          .tpr project file into avisynth.

    3.12) Videos containing mixed-fps/vfr (variable frame rate) must be IVTC'ed to preserve the vfr
          if IVTCing them normally causes jumpy/choppy playback.
    3.13) Deinterlacing the entire video is not permitted on IVTC'able or progressive sources.
    3.14) Extended videos are considered different versions from that of non-extended versions and therefore
          can not be used to proper non-extended versions.  Refer to rule 8.1 for how to name extended versions.
    3.15) Adding an intro/outro, or watermark is not allowed.
    3.16) Freely available content, such as videos downloaded from YouTube, or subscriber based services
          that don't require payment, must be pre'd as internal.
    3.17) 25->24/23.97 (PAL->NTSC FILM).  If sped up video requires an audio edit, such as input with sfx or
          an audio cut, source audio must be used at 25fps. If no edit is needed, use replacement audio at 23.97/24.
    3.18) Converting 2D <-> 3D is not allowed.
    3.19) If DVD5 and DVD9 sources are both available, DVD9 must be used.


######  CROPPING  ##############################################################


    4.1)  Cropping the picture must be avoided if possible.

          * Stretched/duplicate lines caused by the provider are not considered part of the
            video and must be cropped out!

    4.2)  Black letterboxing/borders (partial or full) must be removed.
    4.3)  Both horizontal and vertical resolution must be cropped so the resulting resolutions are mod8.
    4.4)  Cropping is allowed using the MKV container.  When doing this, define the correct AR
          when muxing with mkvmerge.  The encoded source must be uncropped, and the mod8 requirement in
          4.3 is also unnecessary.

          * This feature works correctly using newer mpc/mpc-hc, haali splitter & coreavc.  However, while
            other player/spitter/codec combinations may work as well, some still haven't added support yet
            or their support isn't 100% (such as with VLC).  While allowed, mkv cropping isn't recommended
            until it works correctly in more player/codec combinations.


######  x264  ##################################################################


    5.1)  Encoding must be done using within 50 revisions up to the most current x264.exe from http://x264.nl
          at the time of pre.
    5.2)  Codecs supporting VFW are NOT permitted!
    5.3)  Rips must use one of the following:  main profile (level 3.0) for non-HD
                                               high profile (level 4.1) for HD

    5.4)  CABAC encoding must be used.
    5.5)  In-loop filtering must be used.
    5.6)  Average quantizer must be lower than 28 for SD, and 30 for HD.  Recommended is 24 or less.

          * You can use the "average drf:" field in avinaptic to check this, or use the following
            formula:

            AVERAGE=(I-Frame avg*I-Frames+B-Frames avg*B-Frames+P-Frame avg*P-Frames)/total frames

          * "--aq-mode" has nothing to do with this.  2 pass, crf, and abr videos can have their
            average quantization value calculated.

        5.6.1) If a higher quantizer is needed then the reason must be stated in the nfo.
        5.6.2) qp is not allowed.

    5.7)  When using a non-square pixel shape, you MUST encode using the "--sar x:y" option and
          mux with "--engage keep_bitstream_ar_info".  SAR can be calculated using the following
          formula in the following examples:

                 SAR = (cropped DAR X * cropped height):(cropped DAR Y * cropped width)

          ex. 1: SAR = (16 * 576):(9 * 480)
                 SAR =    9216   :   4320
                 SAR =         32:15

          ex. 2:       cropped DAR X * cropped height    16 * 576   9216
                 SAR = ------------------------------    -------- = ----  SAR = 32:15
                       cropped DAR Y * cropped width      9 * 480   4320

    5.8)  REQUIRED encoder settings:

        5.8.1) --aq-mode must be enabled
        5.8.2) --bframes 3 (if vertical res is greater than 864), otherwise --bframes 16
        5.8.3) --subme 9 (or higher)
        5.8.4) --ref 4 (if vertical res is greater than 864), otherwise --ref 5
        5.8.5) --me umh (or higher)
        5.8.6) --trellis 1 (or higher)
        5.8.7) --merange 32 (if vertical res is greater than 864), otherwise --merange 24


######  SD (Standard Definition)  ##############################################


    6.1)  Maximum allowed average bitrate is 6000 kbps.
    6.2)  Maximum allowed resolution is 720x576.


######  HD (High Definition)  ##################################################


    7.1)  Source resolution must have a minimum of 1280 horizontal pixels or 720 vertical pixels.
    7.2)  For converts, same rules apply as for Standard Definition.
    7.3)  Upscaled sources are NOT true High Definition and are not allowed for
          HD releases.  These must be ripped according to Standard Definition.
    7.4)  Maximum allowed average bitrates are as follows:

        7.4.1) 720p is 10000 kbps.
        7.4.2) 1080p is 14000 kbps.

    7.5)  1080i sources which aren't IVTC'able must be scaled to 720p.

        8.1.3) The RETAIL tag is reserved for content from publicly accessible retail outlets, purchased
               directly by the group ripping the video(s).

               * Non-free subscriber-based services (such as Promo Only and Rock America) are NOT retail
                 outlets.  You are paying for a service, not purchasing content.

        8.1.4) Rips containing a non-english majority of vocals must be tagged with the corresponding
               ISO 639-1 language code: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes

    8.2)  SFV and NFO are required.
    8.3)  Live performances, including pre-recorded, must include the show name (if applicable)
          and original broadcast date.  If the performance wasn't broadcast (such as concerts
          released straight-to-video), use the date of the performance. Live performances used as music
          videos do not need a date.
    8.4)  Events & awards shows occurring annually or less frequent (such as the Grammys and Rock am Ring),
          or occur more than once a year and are named with an edition/series number (such as The Dome),
          must be tagged with the show name and year OR the edition/series number.
    8.5)  The appropriate tags, outlined in 8.1, must be used when applicable.
    8.6)  RARing is at the rippers discretion but recommended for releases >=500MB.  RAR'ed releases
          must be packaged as follows: 15MB, 50MB, 100MB or 200MB rars, and a 1 minute sample.

        8.6.1) RARing single file releases <500MB is not allowed.


######  CONCERTS, LIVE PERFORMANCES, FREESTYLES, ETC.  #########################


    9.1)  Multi-pass vbr or crf encoding must be used for these. You may also split into
          separate tracks (NOT separate releases).

    9.2)  Two or more songs by the same artist, from the same performance/event, ripped to
          individual files must be packaged in ONE release, similar to an MP3 album, for example:

                CONVERT HD DDC/SD DDC RETAIL
                CONVERT SD DDC

        * NOTE: We want to allow users the choice of both fullscreen/widescreen rips, not force one or
                the other simply because it was released first.  That is why native HDTV rips are
                allowed after SD dvdrips, as long as a native BluRay doesn't exist.

    11.6) We do not acknowledge releases pred in other sections therefore no release in MVID is subject
          to dupe of a non-MVID release.

    Some example PROPER/NUKE reasons are as follows:

    12.1)  out-of-sync audio
    12.2)  incomplete or missing audio/video
           * NOTE widescreen can not be propered by fullscreen with this reason!
    12.3)  improper or no IVTC when applicable
    12.4)  1 or more frames containing interlace
    12.5)  incorrect aspect ratio
    12.6)  out-of-spec encodes
    12.7)  very bad audio/video quality (including low bitrate on high motion videos)
    12.8)  improper audio replacement (excluding concerts/live performances)
    12.9)  lip-sync or audio sync to source is broken
    12.10) missing 1 or more sound effects (profanity is NOT a sound effect!)

           * NOTE: if the video is available with and without sound effects, each is
             considered to be a different version from the other.

    12.11) bad cropping

        12.11.1) When propering for overcrop, the proper must have a minimum resolution of the video
                 it's propering, PLUS at least 6 more pixels worth of image on either the horizontal
                 and/or vertical.

    12.12) one-click tool (such as GordianKnot) was used for encoding
    12.13) disabled CABAC for x264 encodes
    12.14) improper naming/tagging
    12.15) unnecessarily re-encoded audio
    12.16) stream errors
    12.17) missing/incorrect/false .nfo

        * NOTE TO NUKERS/RIPPERS:

          If you don't know how to determine things like progressive ghosting vs. a bad ivtc, or a
          bad ivtc in general, please ask!  We'll be more than happy to explain anything regarding
          our rules to eliminate any confusion!

          Use common sense.  For example, we list all valid tags in rule 8.1.  Any tag not listed
          in rule 8.1 is obviously invalid and therefore not allowed, and therefore nukable.

          Some groups take advantage of mkvcrop so make sure you're using a compatible player before
          nuking for "bad.crop"!
