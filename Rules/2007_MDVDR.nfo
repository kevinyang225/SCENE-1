Music DVDR Rules - Draft 1.0 rev.c 

General: 
	. Release size must be at 4.3-4.37 Gb unless source is DVD5. 
	. PAL after NTSC and NTSC after PAL is allowed. 
	. DVD9 after DVD5 and DVD5 after DVD9 is allowed. 
		If DVD5 is pred by another group AFTER the DVD9 then 
		is suggested to include proofs of the source (scans or 
		wathever). 
	. Boxset = More than one disc. ALL discs in one release. ·separated by subdirectories 
		Separated disc release forbidden 


Video: 
	. Re-encoding: 
		. CCE version 2.50+ MUST be used in all circumstances 
		  where transcoding (re-encoding) of the video stream 
		  is required. REmpeg and TMPGenc are NOT allowed. 
		  New unknown or unreleased encoders are not strictly 
		  forbidden, however use at your own risk. 
		. Automated Programs that perform DVD9>DVD5 rips are 
		  FORBIDDEN, e.g. InstanCopy, DVDXCopy, DVDShrink etc. 
		. Minimum average bitrate allowed is 3000 kbit/s 
		  If minimum average bitrate cannot be achieved, 
		  a valid explanation is required in the NFO. 
		. If a release is reauthored then video MUST be 
		  deinterlaced if needed. 
	. Quality Settings: 
		. CCE: 
			. No CBR. Multipass is to be enforced. 
			. The initial 1st pass that encodes the .vaf file 
			  in CCE is NOT considered within the multipass set. 
			. The number of passes required for main movie is to 
			  be determined by the final avg bitrate. Under 
			  4,000k/s 6+ passes required, over 4,000k/s 
			  5 passes are required. 
			. VTS Sectors must always be gotten. 
	. Extras: 
		. Extras are an added value but are not needed. Extras are 
		  allowed to be transcoded/stripped/left-untouched 
		  @ ripper's discretion. 
		. A minimum of 5 passes for extras is required if transcoded 
	. Menus: 
		. Menus MUST be included. In extreme cases where the retail does 
		  not contain a menu, it must be mentioned in the NFO. 
		. Removing useless links within the menu is required. If you 
		  remove something, disable or remove the button. 
		. If all else is stripped and still can't get a 3000k/s avg 
		  bitrate, then the menu may be reencoded at a minimum of 
		  3000k/s avg. 
		. Splitting: 
		. In extreme cases where even if minum bitrate is reached but 
		  video quality remains low (like live concerts with lots of 
		  flash and moving) the decision to split release in more discs 
		  is left @ ripper's discrection. (DON'T ABUSE) 
		  Splitting releases aint cause for PROPER without tech failure 


Audio: 
	. Audio Priority is: DD 5.1 > LPCM 2.0 > DTS 
	. First thing to strip off is DTS, then, if more space is needed 
	  to reach the minimum bitrate, LPCM must be stripped. 
	. In extreme cases, where source has ONLY LPCM audio stream 
	  (most PROMOs), and video avg bitrate is too low for being re-encoded, 
	  ripper can re-encode audio to fit into DVD5. AC3 MUST be used.

DVD Limitations: 
	. Macro vision MUST be removed. 
	. All user limitations and restrictions MUST be removed. 
	. Releases MUST be made region free. 
	. Any new unmentioned copy protection that comes out MUST be stripped. 



Packaging: 
	. All releases MUST either use .IMG or .ISO. Other formats 
	  are NOT allowed. 
	. Releases must be broken up into rars of 50,000,000 bytes. 
	. Recovery Record MUST be used. 
	. Compression method must be store. 
	. SFVs and NFOs MUST be included. 
	. NFO MUST include the following: 
	. Artist name. 
	. Title. 
	. Region, NTSC or PAL. 
	. Number of Passes and Bitrate used when re-encoding 
	  main movie. 
	. Number of Passes and Bitrate used when re-encoding 
	  extras. 
	. Audio streams, and subtitles included. 
	. What has been stripped, extras, menu, etc. 
	. Number of archive files. 
	. Url to a website with retail infos. 
	. Tracklist. 
	  For multi-discs releases technical infos like audio streams, 
	  video bitrate, extras, etc., from ALL DISCS MUST be present. 
	  For live shows is really appreceated the show's year at least 
	  in rel notes. 


Samples: 
	. Samples are required. Minimum size shall be 30mb, but must be 
	  no more than 50mb. 
	. Samples must be put in a separate sub directory, labeled 
	  'Sample'. 
	. Samples MUST be from actual packed vob. Separate encodes are 
	  not allowed. 
	. Multi-discs / Boxsets: 
	. 1 sample per disc no matter how many discs the release is. 
	. That goes for splitted discs also. 

Sources: 
	. Bonuses: 
		. A release MUST be pred as BONUS when the dvd disc isn't sold 
		  alone (for example cd+dvd). 
	. Bootlegs: 
		. A bootleg recording is a dvd that was not officially released 
		  by the person/company owning the rights to do that 
		  (for example streetmixes, pirate live dvds, etc). 
	. Customs: 
		. A custom is an homemade dvd made from not-dvd sources 
		  (DVB VHS and so on) in that case source MUST be specified. 


Directory Naming: 
	. ALL releases are to include production year. 
	. Directory name MUST include REGION (NTSC or PAL). 
	. Acceptable characters are as follows: 
	  ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ 
	  abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz 
	  0123456789 . -_ 
	. Non-Complete DVD-9 releases are to be named as: 
	  MOVIE.TITLE.YEAR.OTHERS.SOURCES.REGION.MDVDR-GROUP 
	. OTHERS are: 
	  BONUS BOOTLEG PROMO PROPER DiRFiX 
	  REPACK COMPLETE #DiSC 
	  (COMPLETE tag isn't mandatory) 
	. SOURCES are to be used if different from DVD so: 
	  VHS DVB etc 
	  those sources MUST be specified either in tag and nfo. 
	. Sub directories are to be labeled as DISC1, DISC2, etc. 
	. EXTRA and CD1, CD2 dirs are NOT allowed. 


Propers: 
	. Propers will ONLY be released if previous had technical flaws 
	  such as menu errors, bad quality, etc. 
	. Just because a previous release was not COMPLETE does not 
	  provide a legitimate reason to PROPER/DUPE. 
	. Propers based on previous releases having improper dir names 
	  will not be tolerated. 
	. PPF patches should be used for fixing releases with simple 
	  problems such as RCE/Region coding, VTS sectors, P-Ups and 
	  so forth. REPACKS/PROPERS should be avoided if a PPF patch is 
	  possible.
