                       THE 2007 MDVDR RELEASING STANDARDS                      

_______________________________________________________________________________

 GENERAL:

        . Downsampled DVD-9 release size must be at 4.3-4.37GB,
          unless source is DVD5.
        . PAL after NTSC and NTSC after PAL is always allowed, 
          and DVD9 after DVD5 and DVD5 after DVD9 is allowed.
        . If DVD5 is pred by another group AFTER the DVD9,
          then proof MUST be included of the source. 
        . Boxset = More than one disc. ALL discs in one release 
          separated by subdirectories (DISC1, DISC2, etc.)

_______________________________________________________________________________

 VIDEO:

 . Re-encoding:

        . CCE version 2.50+ or newer must be used in all
          circumstances where transcoding (re-encoding) of the 
          video stream is required. REmpeg and TMPGenc are NOT
          allowed period.
          New unknown or unreleased encoders are not strictly
          forbidden, however use at your own risk.
        . Automated Programs that perform DVD9>DVD5 rips are
          FORBIDDEN, i.e. DVDShrink, DVDXCopy, InstantCopy, etc.
        . Minimum average bitrate allowed is 3000kbps. If the
          minimum average bitrate cannot be achieved, a valid 
          explanation is required in the NFO.

 . Quality Settings:

        . No CBR. A variable bitrate MUST be used.
        . The initial first pass that encodes the .vaf file 
          in CCE is NOT considered within the multipass set.
        . The number of passes required for a movie is to be
          determined by the final average bitrate. Under 
          4000kbps 6+ passes required, over 4000kbps
          5+ passes are required.

 . Extras:

        . Extras are an added value but are not needed. Extras are 
          allowed to be downsampled/stripped/left-untouched at the
          rippers discretion. 
        . A minimum of 5+ passes and 1900kbps average bitrate for 
          extras is required if downsampled.

 . Splitting: 

	. In extreme cases where even if minimum bitrate is reached but
          video quality remains low (such as live concerts with lots of 
          flash and moving) the decision to split release into 2 or more
          discs is left to the ripper's discrection. Also acceptable if
          the bitrate is way below the minimum. (DON'T ABUSE)

 AUDIO: 

        . Audio Priority is: DD5.1 > LPCM > DD2.0 > DTS
        . If space is needed to reach the minimum bitrate, it's a rippers 
          choice on what streams should be stripped. DD5.1 should always 
          be favored over DD2.0.
        . In extreme cases, where source has ONLY LPCM audio stream 
          (most Promo's), and video average bitrate is too low for being 
          re-encoded, ripper can re-encode audio to fit into DVD5. AC3
          MUST be used in this case.
        . In cases where audio streams are stripped, IFOEdit is suggested
          to strip the streams and VOB ID's.

        . DTS is an issue that cannot be ignored. However, it is not 
          up to us to decide whether they should be allowed or not. 
          Rather, it's up to the SITES that will determine their own 
          appropriate rules. However, those groups that wish to release 
          should name their directory clearly with the appropriate tag
          of DTS or DTS-ONLY.

 MENUS: 

        . Menus MUST be included. In extreme cases where the retail does 
 	  not contain a menu, it must be mentioned in the NFO.
	. Removing useless links within the menu is required. If you 
          remove something, disable or remove the button. 
        . If all else is stripped and still can't get a 3000kbps average 
          bitrate, then the menu may be re-encoded at a minimum of 3000kbps
          average.

_______________________________________________________________________________

 DVD LIMITATIONS:

        . All user limitations and restrictions must be removed.
        . Antipiracy warnings and dummies are preferred to be removed.
        . Any new unmentioned copy protection that comes out 
          (i.e. ARcoSS) must be stripped.
        . Macro vision must be removed.
        . Releases must be made region free.
        . RipIt4Me along with DVD Decrypter is a good suggestion
          to remove all above.

 PACKAGING:

        . All releases must either use .IMG or .ISO. Other formats
          are NOT allowed.
        . An SFV and NFO MUST be included.
        . Compression method must be store.
        . DVD5 Releases must be broken up into rars of 50,000,000 bytes.
        . DVD9 Releases must be broken up into rars of 100,000,000 bytes.
        . Recovery Record MUST be used (1-5%).
        . NFO must include the following:
          . Audio streams and subtitles included.
          . Number of Passes and Bitrate used when re-encoding 
            main movie (if needed).
          . Number of Passes and Bitrate used when re-encoding 
            extras (if needed).
          . IMDB, or any link to the DVD itself will suffice.
          . Number of archive files.
          . Region, NTSC or PAL (Also R0-R8 is suggested).
          . Title of the DVD.
          . What has been stripped, audio, extras, menu, etc.
          . All other information such as track lists, or any other
            info is at rippers discretion. 

 SAMPLES:

        . Samples are required. Minimum size shall be 30mb, but must be
          no more than 100mb.
        . Samples must be from the actual packed DVD. Seperate encodes or
          using original source (if re-encoded) are not allowed.
        . Samples must be put in a separate sub directory, labeled
          "Sample".
        . VOBSplitter or ChopperXP are recommended for making samples.
 
 DIRECTORY NAMING:
        
        . Acceptable characters are as follows:

             ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
             abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
             0123456789 . - _

        . ALL releases are to include production year. Since Music DVD's
          are considered STV, this would be the DVD release year.
        . Directory name MUST include REGION (NTSC or PAL).

        . Complete DVD-5 releases should be named as:
          MOVIE.TITLE.YEAR.REGION.FULL.MDVDR-GROUP or 
          MOVIE.TITLE.YEAR.REGION.COMPLETE.MDVDR-GROUP
          

        . Non-complete DVD-5 releases should be named as:
          MOVIE.TITLE.YEAR.REGION.MDVDR-GROUP

        . Untouched DVD-9 releases should be named either:
          MOVIE.TITLE.YEAR.REGION.MDVD9-GROUP or 
          MOVIE.TITLE.YEAR.REGION.DVD9.MDVDR-GROUP

        . Bonuses: 
          . A release MUST be pred as BONUS when the dvd disc isn't sold 
            alone (i.e. CD+DVD combo).
 
        . Customs: 
          . A custom is a homemade dvd made from non-dvd sources 
            (DVB, VHS and so on) in that case the source MUST be specified. 

        . Tags that can and should be used when needed: 
          # of DISCS BONUS BOOTLEG DIRFIX DVB PROMO PROPER REPACK 
  
        . Sub directories are to be labeled as DISC1, DISC2,
          etc. CD1, CD2, EXTRA directories are NOT allowed.

_______________________________________________________________________________

 PROPERS:

        . Propers will ONLY be released if previous had technical flaws
          such as menu errors, bad quality, etc.
          PPF patch cant fix such things. 
        . Just because a previous release was not COMPLETE does not
          provide a legitimate reason to PROPER/DUPE.
        . Propers based on previous releases having improper dir names
          or missing information in the .nfo will not be tolerated.
        . PPF patches should be used for fixing releases with simple
          problems such as RCE/Region coding, VTS sectors, P-Ups and
          so forth. REPACKS/PROPERS should be avoided if a PPF patch is
          a possible fix.
