<B>No Dupes !</B> <BR>
    Complete albums/releases are checked, not single tracks. So a release is not a dupe if it has different or more tracks.<BR>
    Exceptions: <BR>
    <OL> 
    <LI>It's also a dupe if the complete release is included in a previous one.
        For example CDM is released, now someone releases the CDS and all tracks of the CDS were already included on the CDM (excactly the same tracks).<BR>
        <BR>
    <LI>You are allowed to create a duplicate release from a release that has a source of lower quality.<br>
        Example: if vinyl is out then a CD-release is allowed.<br>
        If you do that then please add this info to NFO and dirname.<br>
        For online bought MP3s (-WEB-) we assume the best source quality (CDDA or better) -> you need proofs that 
        your source is better if you want to dupe a web release.<br>
<FONT COLOR="#ffeeaa"><B><i>
Note:<br>
That does not mean every WEB release is perfect. If there are probs with the WEB release like "bad rip", "bad quality", etc then of course it's allowed to proper.
</B></FONT></i>
        <BR>
    <LI>All MIXED cds should be ripped as one track supplied with a .cue.
        If they are not, they may be duped by another group that releases it as one track with a .cue supplied.<BR>
        <BR>
    </OL>
   Note: if you want to release an import-album or some "extendend edition" then check rule 7 as well !<br>
<LI>

<BR>
<B>An .SFV and .NFO file must be included in every release. </B><BR>
   If you release a CUE file for multitrack mp3s then the CUE file must 
   include artist and tracknames if they are available on the cover or inlay.<br>

<BR>
<LI>
<B>Directoryname must at least contain:</B> <BR>
    <OL> 
    <LI>
    Artist Name - Title - Published Year (decimal) - Group name<BR>
    (extra info is allowed of course)<BR>
<FONT COLOR="#ffeeaa"><B><i>
Note:<br>
That "(decimal)" has been added because in the past some groups thought it's funny to write roman numerals. There is
only one system allowed: decimal integer numbers using the gregorian calender. Other systems getting nuked.
</B></FONT></i>
   <br>
    <LI>
    All bootleg releases must have the word BOOTLEG in dirname. (check bootleg rule 14)<br>
    <br>
    <LI>
    If you release magazine CDs then you must tag them as -MAG-. 
    Don't tag them -PROMO-, -ADVANCE- etc..<br>
    </OL>
    <br>
    Exception:<br>
    If a vinyl/cd has no title then it's allowed to replace the title by 
    labelname+catnumber (both!). If there is only one artist on the vinyl/cd 
    then you must add the artistname.<br>

<BR>
<LI>
<B>Filename must at least contain: </B><BR>
    Track Number - Song Title <BR>
    If it's an album with different artists (one artist per track) then you must add the artist name as well
("VA-tracks" like mixes don't need artistnames).
    <BR>
    Make sure that your filename is unique otherwise some sites might dupeskip.<BR>
<br>
Exception:<br> 
If no tracknames are supplied by the source (cd,vinyl,..) then you *must* provide proof 
that these tracks have no names. 
Either by a scan of the original cover of the record company/label (no selfmade cdr or bootleg covers)  
or a link to an official or trusted webpage with proofs. 
If these "untitled tracks" are part of a big mix (no silence between the "tracks") then it's 
considered as one track and you must rip it as one mp3/cue and give this track same name as the 
"album".<br>

 <BR> <LI>
<B>Files/directories must only contain characters  a-z A-Z 0-9 _ . - () </B><BR>
    This is to avoid problems with windows/linux-filesystem and ftp-servers.<BR>

<BR>
<LI>
<B>Self-made releases</B><BR>
    <OL>
    <LI>Self-made <b>compilations</b> are not allowed !<br>
    A self-made compilation is when you select tracks from other sources, put 
    them together and release that as something new. <br>
    <br>
    <LI>
    A self-made <b>MIX</b> or <b>completely self-made music</b> is allowed if it's good. 
    Sites decide if it's shit by nuking it. <BR>
    If you are releasing self-made stuff then that <b>must</b> be clearly visible in your nfo.<BR>
    If it's not possible to see that it's self-made then it will get nuked as bad pack.<br>
<br>
    Exception: if the selfmade release is free available at release time or when you obviously know that it will
    be available soon then it's not allowed to release it.<br>
    </OL><br>

    If it's not clear if it's selfmade or not and it's not possible to find any information about
    the release/artist/label then it's up to the group to prove that this release is not selfmade
    (coverscan, url, ...). If they are not able to prove that it's real it will get nuked as bad pack.<br>

<br><FONT COLOR="#ffeeaa"><B><i>
Note:<br>
"self-made" means done by you or a groupmember or a close friend. So your group is "publishing" it.
Such a rip also needs a -HOMEMADE- tag. Check Source Rule.
So it's allowed to release your own music but it must be clearly visible to avoid that groups release some 
fakecrap to get credits.
</B></FONT></i>
<br>

<BR>
<LI>
<B>The entire CD,Vinyl,etc. must be released (not individual tracks)</B><BR>
    If you think it's too much work to rip all tracks you better don't rip at
    all. Releasing the complete CD/Vinyl/.. is necessary because otherwise it
    would be possible to make several (different) releases of the same
    cd/vinyl/etc..<BR>
    <BR>
    Exception for albums:<br>
    If a RETAIL album has been released in different editions and the only difference 
    is one or more bonus tracks (imports) then it's allowed to release the 
    bonustrack(s) only. But you may NOT re-release an entire inital edition within 
    the first three months.<br> 
<br>
    Example: album released in US with 10 tracks, japanese edition with 11 tracks 
    (1 bonus track that is a new song) then you MUST release the jap bonus track 
    only (without including previously released tracks of the US album) during 
    the first three months after first full retail release. If it's more than 3 months 
    later then you are allowed to do either the bonustrack-only or the full album.<br>
<br>
    Moreover, it is NOT allowed to re-release a new edition of an retail album EVER if the 
    extra/bonus tracks are already included in one (!) previous release. For example, 
    USA album is released and four months later japanese with simply a remix from 
    an old CDM/CDS still wouldn't be allowed.<br>
<br>
    For DVD(A) releases check Rule 10.<br>

<br>
<LI>
<B>Current maximum directory/filename-length is 128 characters </B><BR>
Exception: Dirfixes that reach the limit by adding "-DIRFIX-"<br>

<BR>
<LI>
<B>No fake-releases</B><BR>
    It's a fake release when artist, title, group or source is incorrect (different).<br>
    examples:<br>
    - Some_Artist-Crappy_Music-2004-<b>GRP</b> not released by GRP<br>
    - Another_Artist-Lots_of_Noise-<b>CDM</b>-2004-GRP was ripped from TV or downloaded from a paysite<br>
    - <b>Madonna</b>-Something_New-2004-GRP really containing some tracks by Marilyn Manson<br>
<BR>
<LI>
<b>DVD/DVDA Ripping</b><br>
   A DVD/DVDA release must contain all music tracks. Additional tracks 
   (interviews etc.) are optional. If those extra tracks are not 
   included then a proper (with ALL tracks) or an additional release 
   (extra tracks only) is not allowed.<br>
<br>
   If tracks are available in several audio formats then you must use 
   the "best" version.<br>
   Priority is: <br>
   - PCM stereo (doesn't matter if DVDA or CDDA quality) <br>
   - PCM 3+ channels <br>
   - AC3 (dolby digital) stereo or DTS stereo <br>
   - AC3 (dolby digital) 3+ channels or DTS 3+ channels <br>
   - MPG <br>
<br>
   Examples:<br>
   - DVD contains AC3 5.1 and AC3 2.0 => you must rip the AC3 2.0 tracks<br>
   - DVD contains PCM and AC3 2.0 => you must rip the PCM tracks<br>
   - DVD contains MPG and AC3 2.0 => you must rip the AC3 2.0 version<br>
<br>
   Normalizing the sound volume is allowed but optional.<br>

<br><FONT COLOR="#ffeeaa"><B><i>
Note:<br>
Normalizing means increase the volume without loosing any sound information. 
Some audio tools are able to do that if the volume of the source is too low.<br>
</B></FONT><br></i>

<BR>
<LI>
<B>Encoding Quality</B><BR>
  <OL>
    <LI> For releases made from MP3s (online bought):<br>
         VBR (all combinations, but no maximum bitrate limit) and CBR is allowed.
         The minumum bitrate for CBR is 192kbit.<br>
<br>
         => You release the MP3 as is. It is NOT allowed to re-encode! If
         the source is below 192 kbit CBR it's not allowed to release it.
         Release the MP3 unmodifed as you downloaded it. Only adding/changing
         ID3 tag is allowed.<br>
<br>
    <LI> For ALL other sources (CD, Vinyl, DVD, etc.):<br>
         You must use either: <br>
         - <b>LAME 3.97</b> (final version!) with preset V2 and VBRNEW ("<b>-V2 --vbr-new</b>") or <br>
         - <b>LAME 3.90.3</b> (modified version preferred) with preset APS ("<b>--alt-preset standard</b>").<br>
         For both LAME versions additional switches which would affect the 
         mp3 quality are forbidden, especially no minimum or maximum bitrate limits.<br>
         <br>
         If you use LAME 3.90.3: preset must either be stored in mp3 header (= modified 
         LAME version) or be part of info in your nfo file.<br>
         <br>
         (If you are going to change your encoder now then switch to 3.97. LAME 3.90.3 will
         be removed from this rule sooner or later)<br>
<br><FONT COLOR="#ffeeaa"><B><i>
Note:<br>
Everyone should switch to 3.97 now. 3.90.3 is not really up2date anymore. 3.90.3 still is allowed 
to give groups more time to switch. But 3.90.3 wont be allowed forever.
</B></FONT><br></i>
<br>
  </OL>
<BR>

<LI>
<B>Promos</B><BR>
If a release is considered not to have every track from the source
then it must be labeled as a promo and can be duped by any legitimate
retail release that DOES contain all tracks. The legitimate release can
be identified by the CAT number, or more suitable proof.<BR>
<BR>
Promos do not have to contain track listings, they are promotional
material, they are not considered legitimate releases, and are still
governed by quality rules.<BR>
<BR>
If you release a promo when the retail is already out then you must 
provide proof that this promo is real to make sure this is not a selfmade "promo".<br>
<br>
to reduce amount of fakes:<br>
A <b>one track promo single release</b> must include cover scans/photos.<BR>

<BR>

<LI>
<B>Re-encodes</b> are not allowed.<BR>
Exception: releases of following sources are currently allowed if they are tagged correctly:<br>
<b>DVD</b>, <b>DAB</B>, <b>DTV/DVB/ISDB</b> (compressed digital tv/radio sat,cable,terrestrial), <b>MD</b> (live)</b><br>

<BR>

<LI>
All <b>bootleg releases</b> must have the word BOOTLEG in dirname<br>
A bootleg recording is a cd/vinyl/dvd that was not officially released
by the person/company owning the rights to do that (for example
streetmixes, pirate live cds, etc).<br>
<br>
Because very often it's not 100% clear if something is bootleg there
are conditions when we assume something is or isn't bootleg. This is
not a defnition of "bootleg" and if a condition is not true then it
does not mean the opposite is true. This only helps nukers and groups
to decide if a bootleg tag is needed and hopefully leads to more fair
nuking.<br>
<br>
conditions for:<br>
<u>[records done completely by the artist] (no samples from other artists)</u><br>
It's bootleg if ...<br>
 - there are no signs that the label really released this<br>
<FONT COLOR="#ffeeaa"><B><i>
Note:<br>
For example someone creates a Madonna bootleg which looks like a retail. 
With logo of label, barcode etc. Everything like a normal Madonna album. 
But it never has been released by the label (or Madonna).
</B></FONT></i><br>
 - the "label" has no connection to the artist<br>
 (independent releases (no label, own label) are allowed and don't need 
 a bootleg tag)<br>
<FONT COLOR="#ffeeaa"><B><i>
Note:<br>
For example rapper SuperKewl releases his records with virgin logo because 
it looks more professional. But virgin never heard of that guy. No info that 
he ever signed, no interviews or articles about that and no info about him on 
virgins homepage.</B></FONT></i><br>
<br>
 even if the conditions above are true it is NOT bootleg if:<br>
 - the record is available at at least 3 major retail shops <br>
<FONT COLOR="#ffeeaa"><B><i>
Note:<br>
When it's on the big shops we just assume everything is ok and not bootleg (even when it looks suspicous).
</B></FONT></i><br>
<br>
<br>
conditions for:<br>
<u>[mixes] (samples of other artists included)</u><br>
It's not bootleg if ...<br>
 - the record is available at at least 3 major retail shops<br>
 - the label exists and lists the record and the label never released
   any bootlegs and released stuff that was available at major 
   retail shops<br>
<FONT COLOR="#ffeeaa"><B><i>
Note:<br>
If the label already had records on amazon, cduniverse etc and never released 
any bootlegs then we assume it's a serious label and doesn't do illegal things.
</B></FONT></i><br>
 - the artist or label of the samples confirms this release is valid (on
   their webpage or some other trusted place)<br>
<FONT COLOR="#ffeeaa"><B><i>
Note:<br>
The owner of the rights for those samples confirmes it was allowed to use 
them. Then of course we also assume it's ok.
</B></FONT></i><br>
<br>
<br>
"major retail shops" currently are: <br>
www.amazon.com (.de, .fr ...) <br>
www.bestbuy.com <br>
www.walmart.com <br>
www.cduniverse.com <br>
www.virginmegastores.co.uk (.gr, .fr, .jp) (US shop excluded) <br>
<FONT COLOR="#ffeeaa"><B><i>
Note:<br>
The US shop of virgin megastores is excluded because it's identical to amazon.com.

<FONT COLOR="#ffeeaa"><B><i>
Note:<br>
shops 1-6 are CD shops, 7-12 vinyl shops.
</B></FONT></i><br>
<br>
The shop itself must sell the record (no private sellers).<br>
<BR>
<FONT COLOR="#ffeeaa"><B><i>
Note:<br>
The shop list will probably change when it turns out that it doesn't have enough shops, has too many or needs shops replaced.<br>
</B></FONT></i><br>

<LI>
<B>FREE MP3s</B><BR>
If music in mp3 format in acceptable quality (CBR 192kbit minimum) or files in a lossless format 
(wav/flac/...) are legally available for download on the net at no cost (artist / record company allows it) 
then it's NOT allowed to release those files or mp3s of the same tracks you made from this or other sources 
(cd/vinyl/...).<BR>

<BR>

<LI>
<B>SOURCE</B><BR>
The tracks of a release must all be from the same source and have the same 
quality/cbr-bitrate/vbr-setting. Taking tracks from other scene releases or internal group 
releases of other groups is strictly forbidden.<BR>
If the source is not a pressed CDDA then the directory name needs a valid source tag.
Valid tags are listed below.<br>

- nearly every DVDA has a copyprotection => very complicated to rip. several tools needed to rip it.<br>
- a DVDA has a DVD Audio logo. Check http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DVD_Audio to see it. Some have
a "DVD Audio+Video" logo. Similar to the DVDA logo, just with "Audio+Video" as text.<br>

simply DON'T do it ! It is indeed unsecure because of possible watermarks and other tracking methods.

<br>
All other "sources" are invalid source tags (-LIVE- , -LINE- , -EP-, ...).
Which means you need a second tag for the source if you use those tags 
(except for CDs which don't need a source tag).<br>
<br>
Additional to the source media the source of the recording is needed for 
direct live recordings:<br>
-<b>AUD</b>- audience microphone<br>
-<b>SBD</b>- soundboard<br>
-BOOTLEG- [unknown]<br>
example tag: -AUD-DAT- -SBD-CDR- ... or in nfo: "Source: SBD->CDR"<br>
(if your pc was connected directly to the recording device then no source 
media is needed of course) <br>

If the source media is digital and you used an analog device (eg. line-in) while 
converting the sound to mp3 then this must also be mentioned in your nfo file.<br>
example: "SOURCE: SACD->ANALOG LINE->PC"<br>

<br>

<LI>
<b>Trackfixes</b><br>
Only one trackfix per release is allowed. If the release needs a second trackfix 
or more than 50% of the tracks need a fix then you must re-rip the whole release 
and all previous releases+dir/nfofixes getting nuked.<br>
A 1-track fix for a 2-track release is allowed (=50% and not "more than 50%"). <br>

<br>

<LI>
<b>ID3 Tags</b><br>
All mp3 files need an ID3 v1.1 tag. This tag must include *correct* Artist, 
Title and Album. The fields Year, Genre and Tracknumber must be present but may not 
be nuked if incorrect.<br>
An additional ID3 v2 tag is allowed and recommended.<br>

<FONT COLOR="#ffeeaa"><B><i>
Note:<br>
ID3 v1.1 means with tracknumbers. ID3 v1.0 was same thing without tracknumbers.

<u>Notes:</u><BR>
<OL>
<LI>Releases with an apparently incorrect year may not be nuked.
However the year should be correct of course. Keep in
mind that a lot of sites nuke for fake year when it's incorrect. (The Year in dirname is not the year when you released
it but when the record company/artist published it!)<BR>
<LI>
  If a release labeled as "advance" is identical to the retail version then 
  the advance turns into a retail release. This means then it is not allowed to dupe 
  it and it counts as retail for ALL rules. If the retail is different then of 
  course it's allowed to release it.<BR>
<LI>Typos (in dirname, trackname, id3, etc ...) are tolerated if it still is readable and either artist or title is 100% correct.<br>
<LI>The audio of a normal video DVD is *NOT* DVDA ! The audio of a DVD usually is MP2/AC3/DTS compressed (lossy) while the audio of a real DVDA is high quality PCM (lossless, e.g. 24bit/192khz). Tagging a normal DVD release as -DVDA- will get nuked.<BR>
